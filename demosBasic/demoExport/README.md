# PyTorch Export Examples

This script demonstrates key features of PyTorch's `torch.export` functionality through a series of examples:

1. **Basic Model Export**: Exports a simple neural network model to an `ExportedProgram` and displays its details.
2. **Dynamic Shapes Handling**: Demonstrates exporting models that can handle dynamic input shapes using constraints on tensor dimensions.
3. **Custom Operator**: Shows how to create and export a custom operator for use in PyTorch models.

These examples showcase the versatility of the `torch.export` API for model optimization and deployment.
