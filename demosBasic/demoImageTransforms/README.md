# Image Transformation Demo

This script showcases the application of various image transformations using PyTorch and torchvision utilities. It visualizes the results for better understanding and demonstration.

## Features

1. **Geometric Transformations**
   - Padding
   - Resizing
   - Center cropping
   - Five cropping
   - Random perspective transformations

2. **Photometric Transformations**
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Color jittering
   - Gaussian blur

3. **Augmentation Transformations**
   - AutoAugment with CIFAR10, IMAGENET, and SVHN policies
   - RandAugment transformations

4. **Preprocessing Example**
   - Demonstrates preprocessing pipelines with bounding boxes using transformations like random resizing, horizontal flipping, and dtype conversion.

The script is designed for showcasing these transformations visually and is helpful in understanding their effects on sample images.
