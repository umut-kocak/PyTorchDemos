# Keypoint Detection with Keypoint R-CNN

This script demonstrates how to perform keypoint detection on images using a pre-trained Keypoint R-CNN model from PyTorch's torchvision library. Key features of the script include:

1. Loading and transforming an input image to prepare it for model inference.
2. Detecting keypoints with the Keypoint R-CNN model and filtering results based on a score threshold.
3. Optionally visualizing the detected keypoints as a skeleton by connecting them with predefined links.
4. Displaying the results, including the keypoints and skeleton, overlaid on the original image.

The demo highlights the model's capability to identify keypoints in images and visualize them in a structured and intuitive manner.
