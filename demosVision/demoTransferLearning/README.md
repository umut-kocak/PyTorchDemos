# ResNet18 Training and Fine-Tuning Demo

This script demonstrates the use of PyTorch to train and fine-tune a ResNet18 model on the Hymenoptera dataset (bees and ants classification). The example includes the following key features:

1. **Data Handling**: Downloads, verifies, and loads the Hymenoptera dataset, with transformations for training and validation.
2. **Model Training and Fine-Tuning**: Implements both full model training and fine-tuning of only the last layer.
3. **Visualization**: Displays sample images, model predictions, and transformed images.
4. **TensorBoard Support**: Logs training metrics to TensorBoard for detailed analysis.

This project showcases transfer learning with ResNet18, a versatile technique for image classification tasks, and emphasizes the flexibility of PyTorch for deep learning workflows.
