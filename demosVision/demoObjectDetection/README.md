# Object Detection with Faster R-CNN

This script demonstrates how to perform object detection using a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from PyTorch's `torchvision` library. It includes the following steps:

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Two input images are loaded and resized for model compatibility.
2. **Object Detection**: A Faster R-CNN model is used to detect objects in the images, with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects that exceed a confidence threshold.
3. **Visualization**: The original images and detection results (images with bounding boxes) are displayed for comparison.

This script showcases the application of a deep learning model for object detection and visualization.
