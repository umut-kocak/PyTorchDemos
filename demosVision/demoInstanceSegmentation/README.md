# Instance Segmentation with Mask R-CNN

This script showcases how to perform instance segmentation on images using a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model from PyTorch's torchvision library. The key features of the script include:

1. Loading and preprocessing input images to prepare them for model inference.
2. Applying the Mask R-CNN model to detect objects, generate instance masks, and categorize detected objects.
3. Filtering and overlaying segmentation masks on the original images based on confidence scores and probability thresholds.
4. Visualizing the original and segmented images to illustrate the model's outputs.

The demo emphasizes the capabilities of Mask R-CNN in identifying and segmenting individual objects within complex scenes.
