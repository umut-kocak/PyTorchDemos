# Spatial Transformer Network (STN) Demo with MNIST

This script showcases the implementation of a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) using PyTorch. The STN is trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits while learning to spatially transform the input images for better classification. 

Key features include:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loads and normalizes the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.
2. **STN Architecture**: Utilizes a Spatial Transformer Network to dynamically adjust the spatial representation of input images.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Includes training loops with support for device-specific optimizations.
4. **Visualization**: Displays before-and-after transformations applied by the STN to highlight its spatial learning capability.

This demo emphasizes the power of STNs in handling spatial variance in image-based tasks.
